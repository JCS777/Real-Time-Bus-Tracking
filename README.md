# Real-Time-Bus-Tracking
<b>Description:</b><br>
This repository contains code from an MIT coding exercise that uses Javascript and publicly available information from Boston's MBTA to create a real-time tracker that shows the location of the bus route that travels between MIT and Harvard.<br> 
<br>
<b>How to Run:</b><br> 
To run this code, copy all the files into the same directory and open the index.html file in your browser. Then simply click the "Show Stops Between MIT and Harvard" button.<br>
<br>
<b>Roadmap to future improvements:</b><br>
In future versions, it might be exciting to real-time travel alerts and schedule updates from Boston's MBTA in an rss feed on the screen.<br>
